 assign intended display text to a variable
 use curved brackets to create a tuple
 use double quotes to enclose strings to form tags
 enclose: in a double quote so it is read as a tag and not a command
 add spaces where necessary
 assign each intended display text one line per variable
 write a print command for every variable, one in a separate line
